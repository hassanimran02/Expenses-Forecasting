# Time Series Analysis and Expense Forecasting
This project focuses on time series analysis and expense forecasting using the Prophet model and traditional regression algorithms like Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Linear Regression. The main objective is to predict future expenses based on historical data. Additionally, the project involves data preprocessing, which includes standardizing features and removing outliers, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build accurate expense forecasting models and compare the performance of different algorithms. We use historical expense data, along with relevant features, to train and evaluate the models.

# Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for analysis, we performed several data preprocessing steps:

## Standardization: 
We standardized the numerical features to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step helps prevent features with large values from dominating the model.

## Outlier Removal: 
Outliers can adversely affect model performance. We identified and removed outliers from the dataset to create a more robust model.

## Missing Value Handling: 
We checked for and handled any missing values in the dataset using appropriate imputation techniques.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between features and expenses. We visualized the data, checked for seasonality, trends, and correlations between variables.

# Models
We used the following models for expense forecasting:

## Prophet Model: 
Prophet is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook. It can capture seasonality and handle missing data effectively.

## Decision Tree: 
Decision Tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It can handle non-linear relationships between features and target variables.

## Support Vector Regression (SVR): 
SVR is an extension of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression tasks. It can effectively handle high-dimensional feature spaces and complex relationships.

## Linear Regression: 
Linear Regression is a simple and widely used algorithm that models the relationship between the target variable and features as a linear equation.

# Performance Comparison
We evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to measure the accuracy of the predictions. The results were compared to identify the most suitable model for expense forecasting.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project employed time series analysis with the Prophet model and traditional regression algorithms for expense forecasting. Through data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, we ensured the data was suitable for modeling. The performance comparison of different algorithms provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
